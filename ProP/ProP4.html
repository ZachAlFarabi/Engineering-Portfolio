            <h3>● Objectives</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this project was to expand my financial modelling skills and knowledge for evaluating a binomial model for European and American Potions,
                and comparing the differences between the two options. This works for the two kinds of options; calls and puts. This was done using MATLAB as a means of
                evaluating the options as matrices. This was attempted to be expanded to include barrier options, however is not finished.

            <h3>● Technical Details</h3>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>Increased my capabilities using MATLAB as a data and matrix evaluation tool to process datasets or parameters. This includes the use of the MATLAB function,
                    in which multiple parameters is able to be used as inputs, and giving an output of the entire underlying and option binomial trees.
                </li>
                <li>Learned and utilised the princiiples of binomial evaluation of option prices and underlying. These are techqniues learned within academia, and were further expaneded
                    individually by myself. This can be used for any "n" steps of binomials. Other functions such as a Black-Scholes model, and barrier models were also created, however was
                    much easier to create as functions.
