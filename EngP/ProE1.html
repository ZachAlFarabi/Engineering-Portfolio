            <h3>● Objectives</h3>
            <p>By following the v-engineering systems process, a full systems lifecycle was conducted including research phases, system requirements, 
                technical design, procurement and manufacturing, and realisation. Novel designs are considered as a creative solution to existing mass-moment
                issues with existing design. Understanding of a bigger manufacturing and systems integration process was learned, including pivoting focus and
                designs to minimise time and cost resources.

            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>Key mechanical designer. Proficient understanding of the mechanical design and manufacturing processes were learned, which mainly includes Computer Aided Design (CAD), technical drawings, and company standards for manufacturing. Process of design to manufacture were further understood as the engineering process proceeded.</li>
                <li>Developed proficiency using Autodesk Inventor to design, develop components, and assemble. Learned to use smart designs for manufacturable and maintanance capabilities. Includes mechanical standards.</li>
                <li>During the design stages for the robotic arm, load and moments pathing were considered before the computer design and material selection.</li>
                <li>Novel design of a belt-drive system for the robotic arm to resolve mass-moment issues from large motors.</li>
