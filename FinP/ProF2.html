            <h3>● Objectives</h3>
            <p>As the Treasurer and Financial Director of the Adelaide Rover Team, no existing methods of managing financial systems,
                procurement, and capital existed. Thus, the objective of my role became to create the financial infastructure and 
                procurement pipeline. This also included running a pioneering finance and sponsorship team, which diversified skillsets
                within the team.

            <h3>● Technical Details</h3>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>Created the entire procurement pipeline, requiring the integration of several corporate systems. This included team requisition, leadership and technical
                    authoritisation, University system integration, and policy intgeration. This ensures team members within the finance and sponsorship team 
                    followed required rules. <i>During my time, we procured 242 requisitions</i>.
                </li>
                <li>University system includes diplomatics with the university business team, finance, and procurement. This ensured all systems were within University
                    standards. This also allowed for maintanance of systems to ensure all procured items are delivered, allowing for communications with the University.
                </li>
                <li>Created an <i>Actual Cost Model</i> to include total costs for international procurement, such as tax, shipping freight, that are difficult to determine for
                    budgetting and journalising.
                </li>
                <li>Created the Cost Report for sending total liquid cost of the rover system to the Adelaide Rover Challenge moderators. These were extrapolated using the master
                    procurement and financial statements.
                </li>
