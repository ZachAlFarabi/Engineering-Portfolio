            <h3>● Objectives</h3>
            <p>As the Treasurer and Financial Director of the Adelaide Mechanical Engineering Student Society, there was a lack of financial management
                or budgetting and analysis methods. Thus, when I inheritted the  role, finances were not in a good state. I developed easy to follow journalising and analysis systems for future treasurers of the club,
                and to help with operations. This helped stabilise finances for the future committee. Additionally, I helped with running events and media operations.
                within the team.
