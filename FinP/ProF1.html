            <h3>● Objectives</h3>
            <p>As the Treasurer and Financial Director of the Adelaide Rover Team, no existing methods of managing financial systems,
                procurement, and capital existed. Thus, the objective of my role became to create the financial infastructure and 
                procurement pipeline. This also included running a pioneering finance and sponsorship team, which diversified skillsets
                within the team.
